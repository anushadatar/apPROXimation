# a-PROX-imation
Modeling and Simulation in Python (Olin College Fall 2017) project 1 code and documentation.

# Summary
The purpose of this project was to focus on a second-order system and mechanics and use a mathematical and data-driven approach to solve an interesting problem. We decided to study the flight of a frisbee, with a "prox" (ID card) hanging from it as it flew between two buildings at Olin College. In addition to source code and figures, we have also included the InDesign file and PDF of the poster used for the final poster session for this project.
